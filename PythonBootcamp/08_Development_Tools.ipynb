    "This is the simplest approach to code development. Use a nice text editor (sublime is a good one) that at least handles indentation. Save your code to a file, and run it from a command line like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    > python myfile.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "This approach falls into the \"non-interactive\" category, but there are many tools available to make it more interactive. For example, simply running python with the `-i` flag will cause it to begin an interactive session immediately after your script completes:\n",
    "\n",

    "<li>Simple, bare-metal approach. Nice if you want to use python without other user interfaces getting in your way. For example:\n",

    "<li>IDEs introduce useful features at the cost of added complexity. (How much time will you spend configuring your IDE instead of coding?) \n",
