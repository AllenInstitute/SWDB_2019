    "<p> In our experimental design, the same 2-photon field of view is imaged across multiple sessions. A cell may be observed in one or more sessions, dependending on whether or not it is active on different days. Cells that are identified across multiple days have the same 'cell_specimen_id' in all sessions in which they were observed. \n",

Set <code>flashes = True</code> to merge across the <code>flash_response_df</code> for the 2 sessions.
